# Rancid Tomatillos

  

## Abstract:

[//]: <>

For the first paired project of Mod 3 at Turing, we built a movie database application. Users can scroll through available movies via tiles, and click on a tile to pop out a specific movie's details where the user can read more information about the movie as well as watch a trailer. Users can also search for a specific movie from the home page. The application can be used with the back/forward arrows, as well. 


## Installation Instructions:

[//]: <>

1. Fork and clone [this repo](https://github.com/trevorfitz0/rancid-tomatillos).

2. Copy the SSH key from the green "Code" button within each repo.

3. In your terminal, use the command `git clone git@github.com:[the link to the repo]`.

4. Run `npm install` -- Do NOT run `npm audit fix --force` when prompted.

5. Open the repo in your text editor to make any changes or inspect code.

6. Run `npm start` in your terminal.

7. Your terminal should pop out the application into a browser window, but if not, copy and paste the generated `localServer` address that your terminal provides into your browser address bar.

## Context:

[//]: <>

This was the first paired project at Turing and our first step into developing with React, Routing with React Router, and writing E2E tests with Cypress. We built the app using Create React App and then implemented both class-based and functional components. We worked with RESTful API's to fetch various peaces of data and performed CRUD methods on those endpoints. In total, the project took us about 15 hours to complete.

## Learning Goals:

[//]: <>

The goals of this project were to (1) gain competency with React fundamentals, (2) learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS, (3) practice refactoring, and (3) create a multi-page UX using Router.

  
## Wins + Challenges:

[//]: <>

Some wins included succesfully using React to stand up our application in a very short period of time. Development that would have typically taken ~twice as long was a breeze. Successfully utilizing component lifecycle methods, conditional rendering, and error handling was a win for the team, as well. 

Some challenges included implementing the "star" rating system, setting up React Router, and implementing the search functionality. With each of these instances, the main pieces of success came from consulting documentation (and googleing when the docs were inconclusive), leaning into classmates, thinking through the problem from different angles, and taking adequate breaks to "hit reset".
